Description:
This program converts text file-alchemy based  to binary format used in LSGI,
The progam Takes an alchemy input file and convert it to binary format to speed up the loading time of the data.
The program also reads the binary to verify if the convertion is correct.

@how to compile:
make clean
make

@parameters:
./binaryConvertor <input alchemy file> <0=alchemy, 1=edgelist only>[

1. 0 input file name in alchemy format
2. 0 input edge list file

@Alchemy format

Alchemy Factor Graph Format:

The Alchemy factor graph form was developed in collaboration with the
Alchemy team (http://alchemy.cs.washington.edu/) at the University of
Washington.  The format describes a discrete factorized model as a
text file with the following form:

   variables:
   <varid>\t<nstates>
    ...
   factors:
   <varid> / <varid> / ... / <varid> // <logP(0, 0, ..., 0)> <logP(1, 0, ..., 0)> ...


@edge list format with factors
0 / 1 // -0.67334 -0.71334 -1.38629 -0.20
0 / 2 // -0.67334 -0.71334 -1.38629 -0.10



@how to run it
example:
./binaryConvertor testCase/graph1.alchemy 0

or 


./binaryConvertor testCase/graph1_3.edgeonly 1



@Output:
it will generete a file with the same input file name with a posfix of ".bin".
