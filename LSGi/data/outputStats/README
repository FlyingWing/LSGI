This folder will store output results for the  inference:
*.timer = times and performance statistics
*.conv  = convergence results
*.tsv	= final states for the inference

The output filenames are created using the name specified in the configuration file used when the inference runs.
The configuration files are in:  ../config/configure*  
#example of configutaion file
#2,2000,../../data/outputStats/outg8,1,10,0.03
then the output file names will be generated as outg8*.conv, outg8*.timer, and outg8.tsv.
