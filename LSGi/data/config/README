README

This folder contains the input configuration for the inference. The filename is passed a parameter for the inference program: ./gibbsApp <config_file> <input_graph> ...

Example of the configuration file:

filename: configure_dns


#Threads,#samples,outputFilename,numasocketsTouse(1;2),#SamplesSnapshop,threshold
1,100,../../data/outputStats/outgdns,1,10,0.03


Description:
This configuration file will configure the engine with:
 1 threads, 100 iterations, ../../data/outputStats/outgdns is the output file, uses 1 socket, convergence test every 10 iterations, and convergence threshold of 0.03.



The list of parameters are:

1. #Threads: Number of threads to use for inference processing. The work is evenly partitioned by the number of threads for each process.

2. #samples: Number of iterations to run. For benchmark we use 100.

3. outputFilename: Filename and path for the local ouput files, the filename is used as

4. numasocketsTouse(1): This parameters should set ALWAYS to 1.

5. #SamplesSnapshop: Number of iterations to test convergence of the graph/

6. threshold: Threshold to verify if the vertex has convergence. We use (0.03 <=) to decide if the vertex id has converge.
